                                My name is Sebastian and I'm currently a student at Lane Tech. It's my second year at the school and my second year doing a computer science course. I joined a computer science course my first year here because I thought it would be fun to try something new and I enjoyed it a lot. I decided I wanted to continue doing computer science so I joined a Web Development class which is where I learned how to make cool webpages and apps like the ones you saw on the previous page.

                                My educational focus as you can probably tell from the paragraph before this is computer science. I love the challenge of it and I like how there's always new things to be learned. When you think you know all there is to know about it and have mastered everything in the computer science field, then you immediately realize you're wrong and you only know about 30% abou what there is to know about it. The computer science field is constantly changing and people are realizing that there are more and more cool things you can do with computers. I love amazing my friends and family with the awesome new webpages I created. It's fun to amaze them with code that they don't understand and show them how all that "jibberish" made this cool webpage.
